		<p style="color:white;"> I grew up playing sports and I love watching them too! In high school I played soccer, basketball, and golf. My favoite sport to play now is golf. I loved watching any Wisconsin sports growing up too! I love the Bucks, Packers, Brewers, and most of all, the Badgers! </p>

			<h2>Sports I've Played</h2>
			<h3>Basketball</h3>
			<img src="imageslis/basketball.jpg" alt="Basketball" width="180" height="260">
				<p> I played basketball from when I was 5 years old until sophomore year of high school. I loved the friendships I made playing basketball, but it was not my favorite sport. </p>
			<h3>Soccer</h3>
			<img src="imagesLIS/soccer.jpg" alt="Soccer" width="180" height="260">
				<p> I started playing soccer when I was 4 years old and played all the way through high school. I also played on a club team called Polonia. Soccer was such a fun part of my life and I still enjoy playing today in intramurals. </p>
			<h3>Golf</h3>
			<img src="imagesLIS/golf.jpeg" alt="Golf" width="180" height="260">
				<p> My whole family are big golf fans, both playing and watching. So, naturally, I became a big fan myself. I started playing competitively in high school. I love to play in the summertime with my Dad and I've had the opportuntiy to play some really cool courses. Most recently over winter break I played in Florida and saw some gators on the course! </p>

			<h2>Sports I Watch</h2>
			<h3>Badgers</h3>
			<img src="imagesLIS/badgers.jpeg" alt="Badgers" width="180" height="260">
				<p> Roll Badge! I love watching anything badger sports; hockey, volleyball, football, but my favorite is basketball. I'm sad to no longer be in the student section next year. </p>
			<h3>Packers</h3>
			<img src="imagesLIS/packers.jpeg" alt="Packers" width="260" height="180">
				<p> Go Pack Go! Growing up in Wisconsin, I am, of course, a Packer fan. I really enjoy football season and being able to watch with all my friends and family. </p>
			<h3>Brewers</h3>
			<img src="imagesLIS/brewers.jpeg" alt="Brewers" width="180" height="260">
				<p> I will admit, I am not a huge baseball fan. However, there's nothing like going to a Brewers game at Miller Park (now American Family Field). Tailgating and playing games and going in to enjoy a nice stadium brat in the warm summer heat. </p>
			<h3>Bucks</h3>
			<img src="imagesLIS/bucks.jpeg" alt="Bucks" width="260" height="180">
				<p> Bucks in 6! As I said, my favorite sport to watch is basketball and the bucks are no exception. My favoirte moment is in 2021 when we won the National championship! </p>
