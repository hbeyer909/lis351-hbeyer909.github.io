		<p style="color:white;"> Going into some things about me. I love to be involved, both inside and outside of school. I spend a lot of time outside school with my friends. I am sad to graduate and no longer live near each other. Lastly, I love spending time with my family. </p>

				<p> I am from Franklin, WI and I love spending time with my family. I have two older brothers, one is 27 and the other is 33. I have 4 cousins on my dad side of the family and then 4 cousins on my mom's side. My cousins live all over the country and I only get to see them every couple of years. I also love being with my grandparents, who I try to visit every time I'm home. </p>
